This repository includes several neural network models, that are evaluated based
on the _Visual Pattern Recognition_ (VPR) dataset. The VPR dataset is derived from
a _Neurorobotics Platform_ [experiment](https://github.com/JeanElsner/nrp-object-recognition),
that creates sensor data for object recognition. This includes data augmentation scripts to 
test robustness to occlusion and novel viewpoints as well as a part-whole consistency.
